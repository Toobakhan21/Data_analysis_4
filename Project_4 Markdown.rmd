## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Q.1 Import the data from machine

```{r lab3dataset}
lab3dataset <- read.csv("C:/Users/WS-User/Desktop/Tooba/Business Decision Analysis/CIND123_ R Studio/Module 1/lab3dataset.csv", header = F, stringsAsFactors = F, na.strings = c("", "NA"))
```

Q.2 Display the first 6 rows of the lab3dataset using the head() function

```{r}
head(lab3dataset)
```

Q.3 Give proper names to each column using the names() function. Going forward, the
exercise will use the following names: ID, Fname, Lname, Email, Gender, Country,
Amount, Date.

```{r}
names(lab3dataset) <- c("ID","Fname", "Lname", "Email", "Gender", "Country", "Amount", "Date")
```

Q.4 Use the str() function to see more information about each column.

```{r}
str(lab3dataset)
```

Q.5 Find out how many different countries are there in the dataset by using the unique()
function. You might need to remove the NA values before counting the number of unique
countries.

```{r}
unique(lab3dataset$Country, na.rm = T)
```

Q.6 Count the number of Females under the Gender column. You can use the sum()
function or a combination of length() and which() functions

```{r}
length(which(lab3dataset$Gender == 'Female'))
sum(lab3dataset$Gender == 'Female', na.rm = T)
```

Q.7 Count the number of NAs under the Gender column.

```{r}
length(which(is.na(lab3dataset$Gender)))
sum(is.na(lab3dataset$Gender))
```

Q.8 Preparing a working dataset 
1. Clean the data by:
• Removing clients who have NA as their country.
• Converting the column with dollar values to numeric values.
• Converting the Date column to data type date.

```{r}
lab3dataset <- lab3dataset[!is.na(lab3dataset$Country),]
lab3dataset$Amount <- as.numeric(gsub("[$,]","", lab3dataset$Amount))
lab3dataset$Date <- as.Date(lab3dataset$Date, "%m/%d/%Y")
head(lab3dataset)
```

2. Identify the earliest date in the dataset and calculate the number of days passed for
each observation. Insert these values as a new column to the data frame.

```{r}
lab3dataset$Days <- as.numeric(lab3dataset$Date - min(lab3dataset$Date))
head(lab3dataset)
```

3. Create an additional column then populate it with a numeric indicator where emails
end with .gov, .org, or .net get 1 and the rest get 0.

```{r}
lab3dataset$IndEmail <- 0
lab3dataset$IndEmail[grep(".gov", lab3dataset$Email)] <- 1
lab3dataset$IndEmail[grep(".org", lab3dataset$Email)] <- 1
lab3dataset$IndEmail[grep(".net", lab3dataset$Email)] <- 1
head(lab3dataset)
```

4. Check if the calculated number of days and the email indicator can be used
to explain the amount column.

```{r}
lma <- lm(lab3dataset$Amount ~ lab3dataset$Days + lab3dataset$IndEmail)
summary(lma)
```
